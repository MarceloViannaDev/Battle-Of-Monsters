# Battle of Monsters

Battle of Monsters, a fun project where different monsters battle each other! In this project, you'll be able to select a monster to battle against a computer-controlled monster. The battle results will be displayed in real-time on the screen.

I undertook this project as a personal challenge to enhance my understanding and practical experience with the technologies I was learning, specifically Redux and Jest.

## Project Description

This project is built using the following technologies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Redux Toolkit: A library for managing state in React applications.
- Material-UI: A popular React UI framework.
- TypeScript: A statically-typed superset of JavaScript.

To get started with the project, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/MarceloViannaDev/Battle-of-Monsters-React-Redux-Project`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the JSON server: `npm run serve:data`
4. Start development: `npm run dev`

Once the server is running, you can access the project in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
